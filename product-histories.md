## WhatsHalal

WhatsHalal is about Halal assurance of 360 million ingredients and food worldwide, all in your pocket. We are building an application that helps consumers conveniently find Halal products wherever they are in the world. Whether you want to order food delivery, takeout, dine-in, buy groceries for your household, learn to cook a recipe, - all you need to do is use our app to scan a product and know without a doubt if it's Halal or not.

WhatsHalal Delivery, Grocery and Fresh are services of Halalonclick, that is being merged into WhatsHalal. It is Singapore's largest and most successful immediate delivery for Halal food since 2014. All new versions of WhatsHalal systems are based on top of Halalonclick's core systems.
