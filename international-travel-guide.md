# International Travel Guide

"Do I need a visa?"

"What do I say to the immigration officer?"

"Can I bring my work laptop with me?"

If you travel out of the country for business purposes—to a company meetup or a professional conference—or even on a family vacation with your work laptop, you're facing up to questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border security.

We have answers!

## Traveling to Singapore

We'll focus on traveling to Singapore since attending company meetups is our primary reason for international business travel.

Here's what you need:

1. A passport! Apply for one now if you don't have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six months.
2. A travel visa for some countries.
3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.
4. Your hotel address and contact info.
5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone.

## Visa

You need a visa to authorize travel to Singapore only for some countries. To see if you need a visa to enter Singapore, check [this link](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/overseasmission/new_delhi/visa_information/overview.html).

### Malaysians and Indonesians

Malaysian and Indonesian passport holders don't need a visa to enter Singapore for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are all that's required.

## Invitation Letter

To substantiate the purpose of your travel, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you're traveling to Singapore for a business meeting and not to do work.

"Doing business"—e.g. attending a business meeting or conference—is allowed under the visitor visa, but "doing work" is not. That'd require a temporary work permit.

## Company Security at the Border

When you enter Singapore, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.

(What's a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with WhatsHalal source code; your tablet where you read WhatsHalal email; your phone where you use the WhatsHalal app; etc.)

### TL;DR: Don't Travel With Work Data

* If you don't need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don't bring it with you!
* If you bring laptop, make sure to create other accounts and use that when asked.
* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.

## Checklist: Before You Travel

* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in Singapore.
* Ensure you have your passport, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.
* Put Salehin and Hatta on speed dial.
  * If you run into general travel issues or have any questions, contact Salehin.
  * If you're detained or encounter some other serious customs headache, contact Salehin by phone. Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is not required to allow you to contact an attorney, but Salehin is your first call if possible.
* 1Password
  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn't have any work logins.
  * Turn on Travel Mode.
  * Open 1Password on each device you're traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it's in Travel Mode.
* Email apps
  * If you use an email app rather than Gmail in your browser, ensure to use Microsoft Outlook app with biometric login turned on and move it to an onbscure and unassuming folder. Make the default email app visible with your personal email active.
* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.
  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.
  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data

* WhatsHalal source code.
  * Make an encrypted archive of your WhatsHalal git repos so you can download and restore it after you're through customs.
  * Delete all WhatsHalal source code from your laptop.
* Other sensitive documents.
  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup and remove from your laptop.
* Dropbox
  * Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.

## Checklist: At Customs

* Have your passport, invitation letter, and hotel address ready.
* Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.
* Common questions:
  * Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting.
  * Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with WhatsHalal.
  * Where are you staying? At a hotel in Bugis.
* Be straighforward and truthful. You're legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.

## Checklist: When You Arrive

* Let us know! Mention in the meetup Slack when you're through customs and have arrived in Singapore.
* Touch ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.
* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.
* WhatsHalal app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.
* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you'll have full access again.
* Email apps: Add your @whatshalal.com account again.
