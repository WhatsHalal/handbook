# Who Does What?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at WhatsHalal, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at WhatsHalal is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

Below you'll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company. They're listed in alphabetical order by group name first and then, when relevant, by team. Inside groups/teams, people are in listed alphabetical order by last name, and the most senior people in a group/team are shown in bold.

### Admin and HR

**Hatta** is WhatsHalal's administrative and human resources executive and the only person on this team. Hatta assists with day-to-day operations of the company, human resources, benefits & payroll administration, and event planning. He's also primarily in charge of coordinating details for our meetups. Hatta is often the best person to tap first, when you don't know who to talk to about a problem.

### Operations

**Salehin** is the head of the operations team. He's responsible for the entire customer support team which respond to customer tickets. His team consists of Dani, Adiwangsa, and Kit.

### Executive

We have three C-level executives at WhatsHalal.

#### CEO

**Azman** is our CEO. He’s principally responsible for setting the overall direction of the company. That means deciding when to embark on a new version of WhatsHalal or experiment with a side project.

#### CTO

**Hong Chuan** is our CTO and runs technology. He’s responsible for setting the technical direction of our products.

#### COO

**Salehin** is our COO and he does the stuff Azman doesn't like to do.

### Software Engineering

This team is led by **Hazrul** and supported by Senior Engineers, **Fahmi**, **Sergio** and **Hasyimi**. All Engineers and Apprentices will be learning extensively from the Seniors and the team conducts itself systematically to achieve the company's goals.

### SEALs

This team is led by **Azman** and **Hadi** and are in charge of sales. Like the actual SEALs, they are the commandos that go in first, recon, and grab the sale. Their elite work is supported by the entire organisation.

### Marketing

This team is led by **Andy** and reports to **Azman**. They take care of communicating to customers and stakeholders in order to get them to do a desired result, like buy from us!
