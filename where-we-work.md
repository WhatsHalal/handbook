# Where We Work

## Office

The WhatsHalal HQ is in Singapore, in the Alexandra neighborhood. 8 people have desk space in the Singapore office, but those people also work from home regularly. We moved into the office in January 2018, and before that, WhatsHalal had no office. The office is also where we once or twice a year gather the whole company for the meet-up.

Anyone is welcome to visit Singapore and work from the office at any time.

## From home

Most people at WhatsHalal work from home most of the time. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course, but please do mind our basic security rules and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.

## From a coworking space

If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. Let us know if you need help with that. Find **Salehin** for a quick chat.
