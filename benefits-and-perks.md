# Benefits & Perks

Since the majority of WhatsHalal employees work in the Singapore, this section is written with that as the default. Some benefits don't make sense in other countries, like private health insurance in other first-world countries with a well-functioning, national health care system. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks outside Singapore as it makes sense though.

## Benefits

### Health Insurance

Health insurance is not available at this time. However, if you are ill, WhatsHalal will cover the consultation fee at any government polyclinic or hospital that certifies your sick leave.

#### Vision

* WhatsHalal doesn't offer vision insurance at this time.

### Vacations & Holidays

WhatsHalal offers 14 days of paid vacation, and the standard national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple extra days, no problem. We don’t track your days off; we use the honour system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking any extended absence, so they’re not left in the lurch.

### Medical Leave

WhatsHalal offers 14 days outpatient sick leave and 60 days hospitalisation leave (includes the 14 days sick leave). You must get your sick leave certified with a government doctor within 48 hours.

### Childcare Leave

Your kids are ill and you need to take care of them. We understand. So long as your child is a Singapore citizen, under 7 years old, and you have been working for us for at least 3 months, you are entitled to 6 days of Childcare Leave per year. If you're based in Singapore but your child is not a citizen, you only get 2 days of Childcare Leave per year. If you need more, you'd have to consume your Annual Leave.

### Adoption Leave

Eligible adoptive mothers are entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption leave to bond with and care for their adopted infants. You may take the leave from your formal intent to adopt but must consume it before the child's first birthday.

### Maternity Leave

When you welcome a new child and WhatsHalal encourages you to take up to 16 weeks paid leave.

### Paternity Leave

Fathers play an important role in supporting their wives after giving birth and we encourage you to take 2 week paid leave.

### CPF and EPF

Eligible Singapore and Malaysia based employees will contribute the enforced employee contribution rate and WhatsHalal will contribute the enforced employer contribution rate.
