# Making a Career

The average tenure of employees working at many technology companies today is shockingly low. At both Amazon and Google, it's [just around one year](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/). At WhatsHalal, we endeavour to average around 5 years or more. When you work at WhatsHalal, it should absolutely be feasible to think about this as the place for making a life-long career.

## Mastery & Titles

Advancing your career at WhatsHalal doesn't mean giving up on your craft and moving into "management". Whether you work in programming, design, ops, support, or whatever, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we're a relatively small company with just two layers of managerial cake: executives and team heads. And both the executives and heads still spend the majority of their time doing actual work themselves as well.

We've mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here's an example of the titles for software engineers:

* Apprentice Software Engineer
* Software Engineer
* Senior Software Engineer
* Lead Software Engineer
* Principal Software Engineer

While this is how we recognize mastery, it's by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. WhatsHalal needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.

But these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at WhatsHalal. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at WhatsHalal_. Someone may well have been a "Senior Designer" somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at WhatsHalal as a "Designer". We recognize mastery and titles at WhatsHalal for the work done at WhatsHalal.

Day to day, though, these titles aren't really much of a factor. It's not like they're printed on your HELLO MY NAME IS sticker at the meetups (not that we have those anyway!). But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at WhatsHalal.

You can see the specific titles and profiencies expected for: [Engineers](https://github.com/whatshalal/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-engineers.md), [Designers](https://github.com/whatshalal/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md).

## Pay & Promotions

WhatsHalal pays slightly above average market rate salary in most roles. We believe in a sustainable business and while we don't pay astronomical salaries at the top 10%, we pay sensible salaries that is more than enough to cover your needs that you would not need to moonlight anywhere else. WhatsHalal does not pay bonuses or AWS and we follow a MNC style salary structure. Promotions are based on tenure, value of work created, and prevailing company budget. As we are still a startup, do moderate your expectations on how much increments you will be getting. We will try our best to provide increments as we grow further.

## May & November Reviews

We perform bi-yearly reviews in May and November. Everyone who has been with the company at least 90 days gets a review.  The primary purpose of these reviews is to give feedback on career path advancement and recognize accomplishments. We wrap up our November reviews in time to make promotion related pay adjustments effective January 1st. We follow a simple process:

* Everyone who joins are to develop their OKRs within the first 30 days of their tenure.
* The head of your team reviews your OKRs every cycle and gives feedback on things to improve.
* The head of your team will schedule a one-hour meeting to discuss.

The head of your team will reach out to you when it's time to feedback on your performance. Of course you can (and should) ask for feedback as often as you'd like it.
