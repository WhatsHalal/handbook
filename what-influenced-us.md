## Books

* [Turn The Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404): "Leadership should mean giving control rather than taking control and creating leaders rather than forging followers", David Marquet. WhatsHalal employs great people and they deserve the freedom and autonomy to act on their own. Don't wait for permission, just state what you're going to do, and then do it.
* [Finding Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114/): True happiness is found in optimal moments of engagement when we stretch just beyond our abilities and lose track of time and space in the process. Protecting the flow by limiting interruptions has been a driving principle of WhatsHalal.
* [Maverick](https://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0446670553/): Ricardo Semler helped us find the confidence to promote and push for weird and different ways of working by showing just how weird and different you can work at even a place as stodgy as a 8,000-person industrial company in Brazil.
* [Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745): Jason Fried and David Hansson greatly influenced the way we envision how we work. We believe in doing more with less and getting things done without sacrificing the important stuff.
* [Remote](https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501/): As you can see, we really love the guys at Basecamp and from day 1 believe that offices are optional. Remote is the way to go and it helps us be productive anywhere we feel comfortable.
