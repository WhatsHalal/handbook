# Our Rituals

## Standups

Daily, all engineers attend a standup first thing in the morning. Standups are conducted over Slack using a Jell slackbot. It is done asynchronously to cater to different timezones. Engineers are encouraged to check the standup logs by 10.30am your timezone to see if other engineers need your help to remove blockers.


## No Meeting Wednesdays

All Engineers are banned from having any project meetings that does not involve coding on Wednesdays. Only full-day pair programming, or clarification hangouts no longer than 15 mins, are allowed.


## Check-ins

Weekly, every Thursday, check-ins are conducted to manage the speed of done. Engineers are expected to push to staging at 3pm and QA/QC Engineers will check against user stories to conclude whether a story is considered done.


## Bi-Weekly Donuts

Bi-Weekly, every Monday, **Donut** slackbot will pair you with a random person in the company for virtual coffee at 9am Singapore time zone. Use hangouts, facetime or telegram video to do a live call for 15 to 30 mins. Work talk is allowed but should be a lesser weightage. Spend more time to share about your hobby, family or cat. These bi-weekly routine is designed to improve team bonding for remote teams.


## Small Batch Push (SBP)

Every 3rd Monday in the cycle at 2pm, we push small batch work that passed Head Engineer clearance to live. Engineers are expected to be all hands on deck to manage bugs and coordinate with Operations.


## Cycle Batch Clearance (CBC)

Every 6th Monday in the cycle, all big batch work will be pushed to staging for UAT with Heads from all departments that have relevant changes in their apps. This UAT only consists of SIT and entire regressive workflows will be revised and approved.


## Cycle Batch Push (CBP)

Every 7th Monday in the cycle at 2pm, all CBC that has cleared will be pushed to live. Engineers are expected to be all hands on deck to manage bugs and coordinate with Operations.


## Cycle User Stories Meeting

Every 8th Monday to Wednesday, user stories for the next cycle will be discussed, debated, prioritised and confirmed. User stories are weighted against epics and objectives.


## F8Off

Every 8th Friday in a cycle, after 2.30pm, the Engineering team is encouraged to sign out and do a virtual team run on Runkeeper. Find **Hazrul** to add you to the group.


## Meetups
Once or Twice a year, the entire company gathers in Singapore for a week. Your first meet-up will be overwhelming; there are a lot of people to meet, most or all of whom you've only chatted with virtually. WhatsHalal will manage your accomodation for you, so you don't need to worry about finding a place to stay.

Meetups are currently unstructured and we would like to take a poll on what you'd like to do in order to get the most benefit.

Lunch and dinners are up to you aside from one all-company dinner on one of the evenings that will be confirmed.

It's important to acknowledge that meet-ups are tiring for a lot of us. We're away from our family, friends, and home for a week. We're interacting all day with coworkers when we're used to working from home. We're having fun and perhaps not getting much sleep. Remember that the meet-up is what you want it to be. If you want to skip dinner one night, skip dinner and take a bath in your hotel room. If you need some recharge time, and want to work from a coffee shop one afternoon, do it! If you want to go to the tiki bar at 2am, don't say we didn't warn you.

Most people leave on Friday during the work day. You should come to every meet-up, but if you have a pre-planned vacation or other engagement you can't cancel, you won't be admonished for missing one or two.
